description: This class corresponds to the Place Nut onto the Bolt task. This environment requires
  the Franka panda robot arm to transports the nut in fingertip_midpoint to the top of a bolt. The initial location of the robot is randomized and the bolt is fixed to the surface in each episode. This 
  environment is designed to  simulate the scene of place in daily life and is a 
  practical skill.
